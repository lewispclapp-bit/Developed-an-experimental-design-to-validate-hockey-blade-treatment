# Developed-an-experimental-design-to-validate-hockey-blade-treatment
Developed an experimental design to test if a new hockey stick blade treatment was better than traditional tape. Gathered data from 8 real players wrist shots. We used a camera to collect rotational data and a radar gun to collect speed data. From the speed and rotational data we calculated the total kinetic energy of each shot. We analyzed the data from each player and the combined data in RStudio using various statistical functions.  If normallity and equal variance could be met then we used an ANOVA to test for if a difference in means was present. Then we used Tukey's HSD test to find which mean was different. If assumptions could not be met we used Kruskill-Wallis test to find if one median differed from each other. Then we used a LSD test to find which medians differed from the rest. We also created some visualizations of the combined data using ggplot functions.
